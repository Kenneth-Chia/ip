# Console UI test plan

This file is the source of truth for the `test-ui` skill. Keep test cases deterministic and update expected output only when the intended UI behavior changes.

The JavaFX-specific manual checks are documented separately in [gui-test-plan.md](gui-test-plan.md).

## Execution information

- Working directory: repository root
- Test runner command: `java test/UiTestRunner.java`
- Java version: 25
- Setup/compile command: `javac -d out src/main/java/sumo/Sumo.java src/main/java/sumo/command/Command.java src/main/java/sumo/command/ExitCommand.java src/main/java/sumo/command/FindCommand.java src/main/java/sumo/command/ListCommand.java src/main/java/sumo/command/OnCommand.java src/main/java/sumo/command/SortCommand.java src/main/java/sumo/exception/SumoException.java src/main/java/sumo/parser/Parser.java src/main/java/sumo/storage/Storage.java src/main/java/sumo/task/DateTimeDisplay.java src/main/java/sumo/task/Deadline.java src/main/java/sumo/task/Event.java src/main/java/sumo/task/Task.java src/main/java/sumo/task/TaskList.java src/main/java/sumo/task/TaskType.java src/main/java/sumo/task/Todo.java src/main/java/sumo/ui/Ui.java`
- Program launch command: `java -cp out sumo.Sumo`
- Output comparison: exact, after normalizing Windows `CRLF` line endings to `LF`; each expected block contains only the response produced after its listed input
- Test isolation: before each test case, delete `data/sumo.txt` if it exists, then launch a fresh program process unless the case explicitly requires multiple continuous sessions

The runner parses the numbered `Command/input` entries and their following fenced `Expected output` blocks. Keep that structure when adding a feature. An optional fenced `Expected `<path>` content immediately after the command` block adds a file assertion to that step. Use `First session` and `Second session` headings when a case must restart without clearing persisted state.

## Test cases

### UI-001 — Add and list a todo

- Aim: Verify that a todo command creates a typed task and that `list` displays it.
- Inputs, commands, and expected output:

  1. Command/input: `todo read book`

     Expected output:

     ```text
     ____________________________________________________________
      Got it. I've added this task:
        [T][ ] read book
      Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
     ____________________________________________________________
     ```

  2. Command/input: `list`

     Expected output:

     ```text
     ____________________________________________________________
      Here are the tasks in your list:
      1.[T][ ] read book
     ____________________________________________________________
     ```

  3. Command/input: `bye`

     Expected output:

     ```text
     ____________________________________________________________
     Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
     ____________________________________________________________
     ```

### UI-002 — Mark and unmark a task

- Aim: Verify that a task changes status when marked done and returns to incomplete when unmarked.
- Inputs, commands, and expected output:

  1. Command/input: `todo return book`

     Expected output:

     ```text
     ____________________________________________________________
      Got it. I've added this task:
        [T][ ] return book
      Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
     ____________________________________________________________
     ```

  2. Command/input: `mark 1`

     Expected output:

     ```text
     ____________________________________________________________
      Nice! I've marked this task as done:
        [T][X] return book
     ____________________________________________________________
     ```

  3. Command/input: `unmark 1`

     Expected output:

     ```text

     ____________________________________________________________
     ```

  4. Command/input: `bye`

     Expected output:

     ```text
     ____________________________________________________________
     Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
     ____________________________________________________________
     ```

- Notes: Run all four inputs in one continuous process so the task state is preserved.

### UI-003 — Explain invalid commands

- Inputs, commands, and expected output:

  1. Command/input: `todo`

     Expected output:

     ```text
     ____________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________
     ```

  6. Command/input: `bye`

     Expected output:

     ```text
     ____________________________________________________________
     Bye. Hope to see you again soon!

  1. Command/input: `todo read book`

     Expected output:

     ```text
     ____________________________________________________________
      Got it. I've added this task:

### UI-007 — Start without an existing data folder or file

- Aim: Verify that Sumo starts with an empty task list and creates the relative `data` folder when neither the folder nor `data/sumo.txt` exists.

     ```

  3. Command/input: `list`

     Expected output:

     ```text
     ____________________________________________________________

## Test-session records

Concise results from completed runs are stored in [ui-test-history.md](ui-test-history.md). Keep execution history out of this plan so the current test definitions remain quick to read.
